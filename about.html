    <h3>Biography</h3>
    
    <p>My name is Kevin Tran. After high school, my original plan was to become a music major and become a musician. While I was in community college, I was working at my parents' furniture store. However, during my free time, I was really into using my computer for a lot of different activities like gaming, school assignments, and using a lot of different applications that were being developed. Also, a lot of my friends were computer science majors and they were talking about building a lot of cool things. Which sparked my interest because I was just imagining creating something that a lot of people would use and would help make their lives easier. Which was how I got into coding. During that time, I was learning to code and I would assist and join my friends club to create websites for local businesses and I had a lot of fun doing that and that is when I started to become engulfed with learning how to code and that was when I decided to change my major to computer science. After that, I moved on to the University of California, Santa Cruz to major in computer science. During my time there, I created a couple of side projects that I wanted to create for myself to help navigate some apps that I already use easier. I also interned for a company named Lyftly and where I was working with a small team of developers to create another part of their application for mental health relief. After my time at Santa Cruz and Lyftly, I moved onto Infosys where I was a software associate and I was working with different companies on different projects they wanted me to work on and Inductive automation after that where I was helping clients with using the companies application and debugging there code as well. I also have a plethora of other hobbies like playing games, piano, studying martial arts, and watching anime.
